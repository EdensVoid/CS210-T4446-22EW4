# CS210-T4446-22EW4
For my CS210-T4446-22EW4 college class.

I chose the Airgead Banking project, otherwise known as project 2, as my submission as it was the project I ultimately did the best on. The project was essentially was to develop a code to oversee investments and compounding interest. It allowed users to see how their investments will grow overtime along with the interest to come based off of a couple of factors such as initial investment amount, annual interest, monthly deposits and number of years. Personally, I thought the best thing about my code was how it was very clean, organized, and provided simple and concise in-code comments. Unfortunately, while I thought I did really well with my code, I had some trouble in using visual studio and was unable to test my code as I went, which feels very bad to me. I prefer to test my code as I go. That's probably the only thing I would change is I would figure out how to test my code every line or two.

While this program wasn't particularly hard to write, I've been since then researching how to run programs in Visual Studio, as well as other coding programs, I feel like once I am able to have some more time for more thorough research, I can jump over this hurdle and really excel. I believe the ability to make clean and easily presentable menus, as well as the ability to process user input through functions in order to provide updated information can honestly be used pretty widely. As far as maintainable, readable, and adaptable code in this program: 
I made sure to provide plenty of spacing as well as in line comments as I went describing what I was doing to ensure its maintainable and readable.
Adaptable, however, well I believe it all just depends on the use in question. I don't believe its very adaptable but I very well could be wrong.

Thank you for the wonderful knowledge and patience this semester,
Lena.
